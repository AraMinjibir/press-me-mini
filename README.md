# Press Me
# Project Description

On my pursuit to have proficiency in JavaScript, I designed this project to test my my basic background in JS.

The Project was designed to ask the name of the user, as the user pressed the button immediately a prompt dialog blox will appear asking the name of the user, after the user provides his/her name a text will appear saying ''Hello [name], nice to see you!''.

The background color will change to darkblue, black and gray for both the container, button and the text and their text color  will change to white immediately when the user pressed the button.
